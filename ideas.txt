def test_format
set up the object under test (calc = Calc.new)
set up any data to pass in (a = 12, b = 30)
do the thing and store result (result = calc.add(a, b)
express expected outcome (expected = 42)
confirm actual matches expected (assert_equal expected, result)



--Mike said most classes won't need to be initialized. How to safely change @chunk without fucking it up?
what needs to be initialized? What doesn't?

--when to close File??

TO DO:

write TESTS!!!!!!
make sure each test goes in order of class methods
make sure each test is uniform looking
make sure each class is uniform looking
DRY.
refactor- divide chisel and bring back fileio
